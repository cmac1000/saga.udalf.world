The 18-foot-tall owner of the flying tower introduces himself as Zephyros, and tells the our heroes that he's come to offer them aid - transportation to a location of their choosing. Colin introduces himself in turn, and Zerphyros smiles broadly, guessing correctly that the other two are Gilbert and "Tarz". He's been contacting the ancestors, he explains, to find a way to repair the shattered ordning, and they advised him to seek out this trio and help them on their journey.

The party learns:

* The ordning, a caste system placing all giants in a strict rank hierarchy, has been destroyed, and that many giants (hill, frost, fire, stone, cloud and storm) have taken this as an opportunity to improve their standing in a new structure.
* There are several competing theories as to what might have caused this calamity, but none know for sure - the giant gods are silent.

The protagonists confer and decide to ask for a lift to Waterdeep, and thence to Triboar, to seek further information from Triboar College. Zephyros agrees, offers them the use of the first floor of his tower, and plots a course to Waterdeep.

That night, as Gilbert stands watch, the giant door creaks open, and a shadowed figure gesticulates at Gilbert as he shakes Taz awake. Gilbert finds himself banished to a featureless demiplane, suspended in nothing. Taz recognizes this villian as Snigbat, shouts Colin awake and springs nimbly across the floor at the intruder, scoring a palpable hit with his rapier - but this victory proves short-lived as Snigbat, her face twisted with malice, pushes a wave of blight over Taz, dealing massive damage and knocking him unconscious. Colin protects himself with cunning magics and calls for help from "Pookie", one of Zephyros' several pet griffons. The battle is brief, but as Colin restores Taz to life and Pookie disrupts Snigbat's concentration, restoring Gilbert to the field, Snigbat is disabled.

Zephyros sleepily descends, wishes the party well, and ascends once more to snooze.

After a breather, the party questions Snigbat, who seems calmer, and reveals that her sudden burst of power was fueled by goblin magic, allowing her an opportunity to seek revenge for an unconsumated bargain. Having failed to kill the party, she seems resigned to the consequences of a descent into the lower planes, but Colin convinces her that the Way of Eldath remains open to her, and thus Snigbat is born again.

The next morning, the tower hovers near a hill on the outskirts of Waterdeep, and our heroes journey to the temple of Eldath to complete their quest. They confer with the temple dean, Iago Aspen-Quayle, with the following results:

* Snigbat is accepted as a junior staff member of the temple
* Gilbert and Taz each receive 50 gold in payment for their services
* Iago seems relieved that Colin wants to immediately resume field work and pursue investigation of the giant trouble
* The temple has, however, refused Xolkin's request to store contraband in the temple buildings, and the Snakes are sulking in a nearby public house.

The party agrees to split up and pursue individual errands for a few days, before reconvening to journey to Triboar.

# Taz

Taz goes to a gambling parlor and starts making bright and chatty conversation with a couple of bouncers. They eventually inform him he's invited to a more exclusive game in the back, and one of them escorts him to a warehouse in an obscure neighborhood. Taz meets with his patron, a man who goes by the name "Mr. Fingers"

> As familiar as the setting was, Taz couldn't shake off just how oppressive the atmosphere had become. Seated on a child's bed in Mr. Fingers' latest 'orphanage', he nervously rocked back and forth in a silence broken only by the clinking of coins as Little Bastard counted out his payment, while Mr. Fingers looked on contemplatively.

> Finally, the 12-year-old announced, "Hey, the pup's actually made his due!" And suddenly everyone was all smiles, the rest of the children clapping Taz on the arms and legs and sighing with some disappointment as they realized he really had given them all the money he had. Mr. Fingers remained impassive a few moments more, then smiled.

> "Well, my likely lad, looks like you're still in the fold after all."

> Taz didn't return the smile.

> "For now."

# Colin

Colin spends his time calling on family contacts to find a way for Xolkin to move his contraband.

> As he walked away from Taz and Gilbert, Colin determinedly squared his shoulders. _I'll ask Arnulf_, he thought to himself -- Arnulf was his cousin, a minor member of the House of Melshimber who oversaw a warehouse that stored the products of the house's wine-import business. Arnulf and he were not close, but they were *family.* _I'll just explain things to Arnulf, and he'll have to help._

> Arnulf, supervising the loading of a cart when Colin found him at the warehouse, laughed outright at Colin's proposal. "No fuckin' way," he said. "I'd have to be dumber than *you* to let the Zhentarim store their shit here."

> Which is how Colin found himself standing in front of the imposing oak doors of the house where the head of House Melshimber lived...

Melanthios Melshimber, Colin's deeply unpleasant uncle, was surprisingly receptive to Colin's overture, and agreed to let the Snakes use the Melshimber warehouses to receive shipments for a few months. As Colin, relieved, turned to leave, he felt Melanthios' heavy hand on his shoulder.

"I like to help my favorite nephew - one of these days, who knows? I might need a favor myself. When that day comes, Colin, please remember our conversation here."

# Gilbert

Gilbert found himself with time on his hands, and he did what he always did with time on his hands: make investments.

> "And I get twenty-five gold just for telling you where the lady is?" the dwarf woman said with no little skepticism.

> "Absolutely," Gilbert said warmly, asking himself why the woman with a sensible pickaxe over her shoulder had seemed like a good idea for a mark.

> But the woman was just off her shift after payday, and twenty-five gold could buy her a significantly less sensible pickaxe. She laid down her money and sat back, arms folded.

> "Okay, okay." Gilbert showed her the cards with a flourish: a queen and two jacks. He flipped them over and picked them up, twitching them back to the table. After a lengthy display of chattering and shuffling, he straightened and spread his hands. "Where's the lady? Find the--"

> The woman turned over the left card. A red queen smiled enigmatically back.

> "Tell you what," the woman said, not unkindly. "You seem fine by me. I'll take half your bid and we'll call it a day, right?"

> "Thanks," Gilbert said to the queen on the table. Maybe he could get Colin to go a round.
