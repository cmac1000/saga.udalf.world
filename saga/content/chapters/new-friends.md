The mysterious blad-clad figures riding into town introduce themselves to our protagonists as "The Seven Snakes". Their leader, Xolkin Alessandar, greets Colin warmly and expresses a keen interest in the number and location of any remaining town guards. He offers a shiny gemstone in exchange for the successful removal of the guards, and is uninterested in the party's suggestion that he might be happier elsewhere.

Colin confers with Torem Breck in the keep, who is unwilling to abandon his post, and urges the party to drive the Zhentarim away. The day ends inconclusively, with the Zhentarim well-ensconced in the town's trading post, and the guards maintaining their hold on the keep. The party spends the night in the keep as well, planning to set forth the next day to find the goblin caves (and missing townsfolk).

The party sends several raven messages from the keep:

1. To Waterdeep to ask again for assistance
2. To Colin's superiors in the temple, letting them know that Colin might be promising temple services to "snake people"
3. To Gum-Gum, to apprise him of recent events

As morning dawns, however, our heroes hear bellows of pain and anger from the northern treeline, as burly figures charge toward the town's palisade. The guards identify these as orcs, and the party waits to see what might happen. After an unsuccessful attempt to climb the northern palisade, the orcs circle around the town, probing for entry points, as Colin booms forth giantish admonishments.

The orcs discover the break in the palisade where the bridge between the town and the keep intersects the wall, and the warchief directs them to swim to it. The guards, at the direction of Taz, take up positions in the keep guardhouse and help the party pelt the incoming orcs with missile fire.

The surviving orcs charge into town to battle the Zhentarim for control of the structures, while the warchief and his cleric and floating spear leap over the broken bridge (through a fire kindled by Gilbert) to attack the keep. Colin is greivously wounded by the cleric, and dives into the moat.

As the warchief and his cleric break open the guardhouse gate, they are met by Gilbert's patented thunderwave, and the guards, roused by Taz's inspirational speech, surge forward. A band of swift wood elves, pursuing the orcs from the forest, begin firing from the west bank. Under the combined attack, the orc leadership falls.

Colin, hurrying towards the sounds of combat to the north of town, finds the surviving orcs beseiging a watch tower with the surviving Zhentarim. He begins manifesting strange wonders, causing the orcs to conclude that they have displeased Gruumsh, their grim god. They are thus distracted when the wood elves enter town and put a swift end to them.

After the battle, a shaken Xolkin accepts Colin's offer to leave Nightstone in exchange for future help from the temple of Eldath. Colin uses his divine magic to spare the life of the dying Kella Matse, and the four surviving Zhentarim leave town with their dead, giving their three remaining horses to the party.

The joyous guards congratulate the party and begin repairing the damage to the bridge, as the party sets forth to rescue the villagers.

Riding forth to the Dripping Caves, the party uses stealth to detect a large ogre bathing in a mud bath through the primary entrance. Colin's thaumaturgical trickery allows him to hold a puzzling giantish conversation with the ogre, named Nob, who doesn't know much and gets confused and sleepy. He does mention that he works for Hark, and that his wife, Bon, lives in the cave as well.

Withdrawing, the party uses cunning disguises to make themselves look like tall goblins, which is almost enough to fool Nob - but apparently not enough to fool the goblin sentry in the cave beyond, who comes out asking angry-sounding goblin questions. The party beats a hasty retreat and explores the exterior of the cave, finding an easterly tunnel with a stream.

Entering here, the party finds a large stalagmite in a cave with two tunnels - one northwest, one southwest. Gilbert, with his wood elf darkvision, ventures northwest, to discover another entrance to the large cavern with Nob and the goblins. Colin experimentally pushes his Eldathian censer into the stalagmite, which hisses loudly and pours forth steam before Colin lets go.

Gilbert and Taz explore the southern tunnel, finding a water pond with long-disused water receptacles lying beside it. As they are realizing that it's oddly long since these have been used to carry water, Colin realizes that a thick black psuedopod has begun oozing forth from the hollow stalagmite...
