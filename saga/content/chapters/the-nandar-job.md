Taz, Gilbert and Colin journey forth from the city of Waterdeep to the isolated village of Nightstone, on a mission from the temple of Eldath.

> # The Nandar Job
> The house of Nandar approached the temple of Eldath in Waterdeep, seeking mediation in their recently-sharp dispute with the elves of the Ardeep forest. The elves, it seems, object to the hunting parties that the Nandars lead into elven territory from their settlement at Nightstone, and several recent such expeditions have led to small skirmishes.

> The temple of Eldath cheerfully nominated their acolyte Colin for this expedition, and put out a notice for auxilliary diplomatic staff. This notice was answered by Taz and Gilbert, each seeking income and connections for his own purposes.

On the way, Taz is briefly rendered senseless by a vicious giant-vulture attack. Bravely, the party fends off the crazed bird.

Upon reaching sight of Nightstone, our heroes find the town heavily damaged by falling stones, the drawbridge down, and the temple bell ringing incessantly. Stealthily, they explore the town, finding a group of goblins raiding the damaged buildings for homely treasures.

* Kella Matse, a woman wearing monastic clothing, seems to be unconscious on the second floor of the town inn. When awakened with Colin's divine intervention, she identifies herself as a travelling monk, describes a recent attack by a floating castle, and says that she'll stay put until help arrives. She agrees to send her flying snake off to Waterdeep to ask for reinforcements.
* Two of the goblins, Vark and Breedo, are convinced by Gilbert's tall-goblin illusion that they should flee at once as more soldiers are on the way.
* Stealthy combat, led by Taz's Solid-Snake-like exertions, lead to the defeat of several more goblins, culminating in a pitched battle in the town's trading post (occasioned by Colin's booming offer of help to any listeners)
* A captured goblin, Gum-gum, describes how the villagers of the town recently sought refuge in the cavern complex north of town, where they were captured by a recently-arrived goblin clan. The leader, Hark, realized that the town was defenceless, and sent a group of raiders to seek plunder. Gum-gum agrees to journey to Waterdeep to inform the party's patrons of the town's plight.

Having rid the town of the goblinoid raiders, our protagonists find a way over the ruined bridge to the town keep, where they find a group of dispirited guards keeping a sad vigil over the body of Lady Nandar, the former leader of the town, who was killed in the giant attack. They describe how the giants bombarded the town, how the town's inn-keeper, a dwarf named Morak, gathered the civilians and led them north, and how a group of giants then descended to abscond with the town's famous, mysterious obelisk. They implore our protagonists to help free the town's populace from the clutches of the goblin leader.

Upon the party's description of Kella's flying snake, the acting captain of the guard, Torem Breck, identifies it as a symbol of the feared Zhentarim, and calls his soldiers to arms. The guards and the party clamber back across the bridge, just in time to see Kella welcoming a group of seven mounted figures through the open drawbridge...
