As the psuedopod emerges, querulously, from the stalagmite, Colin makes a hasty departure to the southern cave to join Gilbert and Taz. Taz peers out with his bullseye lantern, ascertaining that the creature is a black pudding, industriously oozing up the wall toward their cave - he warns his associates, who pelt the creature as it appears around the corner on the ceiling, with spells and missile attacks. It oozes heavily towards them, thrashing around with its strange protuberances, and our heroes find their way around it, back out the tunnel into the great outdoors. The creature oozes back into the darkness.

After recovering their composure, our heroes decide to scout for more entrances, and find a natural chimney. Colin happily wraps himself in some recently-acquired silk rope, and manfully wriggles away from the inhibiting pull of Taz, to leap into the cave, where he discovers a bored-looking goblin who brightens up upon his appearance.

The golbin introduces herself as Snigbat, and makes the following overture: if our heroes will help Snigbat rise to the top of the tribe's hierarchy by eliminating Hark, the current goblin boss, she'll happily turn over the imprisoned villagers of Nightstone. To sweeten the deal for a skeptical Taz, she offers a magical item to help him see in the dark.

Our heroes accept the proposal, and Snigbat delivers: a pair of Goggles of Night, with rampant flying snakes on the bands. Snigbat scurries away, cacklingly.

After a conference on tactics and a quick scouting expedition, Taz and Gilbert array the hallway with traps, and Colin steps forth, boomingly offering Hark glad tidings from the temple of Eldath. A puzzled bodyguard appears. Seeing a lone, seemingly-unarmed cleric, he invites him in to see the boss. Colin enters Hark's throne room, finding a pack of giant rats eating the remains of a luckless villager, with Hark and his guards looking on.

Colin negotiates successfully with Hark, who agrees to ransom the surviving prisoners for the suit of dwarven chainmail that Colin produces. Trailing the chainmail as he walks, Hark leads Colin to the bat-cave containing the prisoners and releaases them, as Taz and Gilbert stealthily depart the cave from a freshly-found side exit.

Colin waves cheerily to Nob as they depart, and impresses on Hark the wisdom of improved relations with Nightstone, as well as the perils of dissatisfaction in the goblin ranks (although he keeps the identity of Snigbat confidential). Hark agrees that Colin may return in the future to confer again.

The party returns the freed villagers to Nightstone, which has a newfound appreciation for the teachings of Eldath, and receive a heroes' welcome. Speaking with Morag Ur'gray, the innkeeper, the party confirms that giants have become increasingly active in the surrounding area, although the cloud giant attack on Nightstone was shocking and unprecedented. He expresses confidence that the newly-arrived soldiers from Waterdeep will be able to keep the town safe, especially now that the orcs are diminished and the nightstone itself is gone. He gifts the party a pair of Sending Stones, allowing remote communication, and advises them to travel to Triboar, where a small university has giant researchers who could use (and might pay for) the aid of skilled adventurers.

* Taz receives three doses of drow poison from the town apothecary, Destiny Agganor, in thanks for rescuing her and her son Grin.
* Gilbert and Colin sell their surplus treasure for gold at advantagous rates
* Gilbert passes himself off as a cleric of Eldath
* Colin advises Morag to name his new, gelatinous chicken recipe after their beloved friend Gum-Gum

Departing the next morning, a flying tower hoves into view and extends a magical spiral staircase. Colin happily ascends to find a cloud giant wizard levitating down from the upper story, booming forth a welcome.
