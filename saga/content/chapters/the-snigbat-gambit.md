As the psuedopod emerges, querulously, from the stalagmite, Colin makes a hasty departure to the southern cave to join Gilbert and Taz. Taz peers out with his bullseye lantern, ascertaining that the creature is a black pudding, industriously oozing up the wall toward their cave - he warns his associates, who pelt the creature as it appears around the corner on the ceiling, with spells and missile attacks. It oozes heavily towards them, thrashing around with its strange protuberances, and our heroes find their way around it, back out the tunnel into the great outdoors. The creature oozes back into the darkness.

After recovering their composure, our heroes decide to scout for more entrances, and find a natural chimney. Colin happily wraps himself in some recently-acquired silk rope, and manfully wriggles away from the inhibiting pull of Taz, to leap into the cave, where he discovers a bored-looking goblin who brightens up upon his appearance.

The golbin introduces herself as Snigbat, and makes the following overture: if our heroes will help Snigbat rise to the top of the tribe's hierarchy by eliminating Hark, the current goblin boss, she'll happily turn over the imprisoned villagers of Nightstone. To sweeten the deal for a skeptical Taz, she offers a magical item to help him see in the dark.

Our heroes accept the proposal, and Snigbat delivers: a pair of Goggles of Night, with rampant flying snakes on the bands. Snigbat scurries away, cacklingly.

After a conference on tactics and a quick scouting expedition, Taz and Gilbert array the hallway with traps, and Colin steps forth, boomingly offering Hark glad tidings from the temple of Eldath. A puzzled bodyguard appears. Seeing a lone, seemingly-unarmed cleric, he invites him in to see the boss. Colin enters Hark's throne room, finding a pack of giant rats eating the remains of a luckless villager, with Hark and his guards looking on.

Colin negotiates successfully with Hark, who agrees to ransom the surviving prisoners for the suit of dwarven chainmail that Colin produces. Trailing the chainmail as he walks, Hark leads Colin to the bat-cave containing the prisoners and releaases them, as Taz and Gilbert stealthily depart the cave from a freshly-found side exit.

Colin waves cheerily to Nob as they depart, and impresses on Hark the wisdom of improved relations with Nightstone, as well as the perils of dissatisfaction in the goblin ranks (although he keeps the identity of Snigbat confidential). Hark agrees that Colin may return in the future to confer again.

The party returns the freed villagers to Nightstone, which has a newfound appreciation for the teachings of Eldath, and receive a heroes' welcome. Speaking with Morag Ur'gray, the innkeeper, the party confirms that giants have become increasingly active in the surrounding area, although the cloud giant attack on Nightstone was shocking and unprecedented. He expresses confidence that the newly-arrived soldiers from Waterdeep will be able to keep the town safe, especially now that the orcs are diminished and the nightstone itself is gone. He gifts the party a pair of Sending Stones, allowing remote communication, and advises them to travel to Triboar, where a small university has giant researchers who could use (and might pay for) the aid of skilled adventurers.

* Taz receives three doses of drow poison from the town apothecary, Destiny Agganor, in thanks for rescuing her and her son Grin.
* Gilbert and Colin sell their surplus treasure for gold at advantagous rates
* Gilbert passes himself off as a cleric of Eldath
* Colin advises Morag to name his new, gelatinous chicken recipe after their beloved friend Gum-Gum

Taz releases the orc warchief, who has responded to all attempts at questioning with angry shouts of "GRUUMSH GRUUMSH GRUUMSH", and tells him, 

"The last couple of days have been, ah, let's say enlightening for me! Really driven home the value of peaceful diplomacy and open-handedness. Maybe next time you are needing something and considering sacking a town for it, you consider the alternatives, eh? Later, man, go team Gruumsh and all that."

The warchief looks around suspiciously and hoofs it into the woods.

That night, a raven appears for Colin:

```
Acolyte Colin:

We received your message. As you mentioned might happen, a badly-scarred man appeared at the main temple yesterday, describing himself as a "friend of Colin's" with some "merchandise" that needed "a place to cool down". We suggested he might be better suited with the storage options of the Bank of Tiamat down the street, but he was quite insistent that he "had a deal" with us. He's visited a few times today.

Relatedly, a goblin came by the temple yesterday, introducing himself as "Gum-Gum". He was insistent on describing to us in great detail the plight of Nightstone and would not leave until we sent a messenger with his description to House Nandar, who I understand has sent a guard detachment to the town.

Gum-Gum seems to be a bit at loose ends since, but is in no hurry to leave - he seems to find the central pool quite relaxing, although we've been at pains to point out that bathing isn't, strictly speaking, its intended function.

Please advise.
Blessings of Eldath,
Thomas Korbinian, Prelate
Temple of St. Reylas, Waterdeep
```

Colin does not answer the raven from Waterdeep; he just nods happily and says, "I'm so glad everyone got to the temple. I'm sure the elders will work something out with the snakes. I'm a great negotiator!"

Departing the next morning, the party finds a troubling message scrawled on the dirt in front of town:

```
a dEal IS a dEal
```

As they head down the road back to Waterdeep, a flying tower hoves into view and extends a magical spiral staircase. Colin happily ascends to find a cloud giant wizard levitating down from the upper story, booming forth a welcome. They don't notice a small, stealthy figure creeping up on the stairs behind them...
