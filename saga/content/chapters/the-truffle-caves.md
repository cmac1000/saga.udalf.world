Early the next morning, our heroes descend once more into the tomb of Granus to investigate the previous night's explosion. They find an unconsious Abeth, one of the two Yartarian graduate students, sprawled by the winch system. Colin revives her and she explains that professors Grisaille and Thinne descended last night, along with Stomes, to investigate the tomb. She remembers hearing a loud explosion before losing consciousness.

Colin escorts Abeth out to rest with the caravan guards, while Gilbert and Taz descend to investigate further. They find the dead body of Stomes, seemingly blasted out of the narrow tunnel dug by the umber hulk. Peering into the room that formerly held the sarcophagus of Granus, they find intact (though smoke-blackened) walls and ceilings, but the floor has given way, collapsing into a lower cavern.

Colin rejoins his companions and they descend into the darkness, where they find the lifeless (and soul-less) bodies of ancient dwarf wights, the corpse of Ulrich Thinne, the bronze-covered dragon skull, and the shattered sarcophagus. Following a trail of disturbed earth, they find that the cavern narrows, and an underground stream enters the narrow tunnel. Just before this, they find the piled bones of Granus, his maul, ring and chain beside them - but the softly-glowing sphere is nowhere to be seen.

Our heroes follow the river into the tunnel and emerge in another cavern, which forks in two. Following the river, they find evidence that Poppy Grisaille has come this way, resting and bandaging her wounds. Groups of mushrooms (which Gilbert recognizes as semi-sentient myconids) rise higher and thicker as they wend their way along, until Taz notices torchlight and horned helmets ahead - he darts forward and discovers a group of orcs.

Colin approaches cheerfully, asking if there's anything he can do to help. The orcs are busily constructing a barricade across the river and laying bundles of something at intervals through the nearest mushrooms, careful not to step on any. At Colin's approach, the leader, identifying himself as a member of "The Broken Tusks", orders Colin to retreat immediately. Colin does so, and the party debates how to proceed. The debate continues as the orcs assemble themselves behind the barricade, ready weapons, and light flaming arrows - our heroes run, and feels a wave of heat behind them, followed by the sounds of battle.

Escaping down the other fork of the cave, the party does battle with a hanging roper. As it creeps closer to them, the strange smoke from the myconid cavern starts to affect them. Taz blocks the rear cavern with a bead of force, efficiently filtering the air and buying the party time to finish off the sinister stalagtite.

The party find an exit back to the riverbank, and decide that Poppy Grisaille is effectively beyond their reach. Departing back to Triboar with Abeth, the caravan guards and Farem, Taz notices a solitary figure crouched on the opposite hillside, watching them. Colin excitedly gives chase as the figure turns and runs, identifying him as a male elf, in a traveller's cloak, with a hawk that departs his shoulder to circle overhead. He ignores multiple hails and makes his way swiftly over the hilly terrain, to vanish to the west...
