The party reunites and delivers the good news to Xolkin that House Melshimber will allow him to use their warehouse network to move merchandise in Waterdeep. Grateful, he offers them a mysterious helmet with a tentacled design; he is vague about its origin.

As the party heads back to the Temple of Eldath, Taz notices a group of young toughs strolling menacingly towards them. Zhentarim operatives appear and wave them away, however, before Taz has to do anything, and give him a nod before departing.

At the temple, the party joins the acolytes for evening meal, and Colin discovers that his new helmet is capable of tuning into the surface-level thoughts of the acolytes. He freaks out Gum-gum with this power, and the accompanying telepathy.

The next morning, our heroes rendezvous with Zephyros and his flying tower, and depart for Triboar. En route, they encounter a strike team of dwarves carried by a silver dragon, who seem intent on disabling the tower. Gilbert successfully implants the thought into the squad leader that this tower is not their target, and the team quickly departs.

Arriving at Triboar, Taz books a room at a local inn, Northshield House. He meets:

* Its polite proprietor, Urgala Meltimer
* A deeply drunk young university student in red robes, who calls himself "Maverick"
* A pair of halfling caravan guards, Calmita and Thamelle Yolienne, operating on the Triboar-Mirabar trade route
* Darz Helgar, the owner of the North Caravan Campground, searching for a missing young man named "Moonbeam"
