Gilbert and Colin head to the Triboar College to find further expertise on the current giant upheaval, and meet a professor, Dyllis Plank, willing to speak with them. Colin explains (in a somewhat puzzling way) their meeting with Zephyros, and Professor Plank nods thoughtfully.

She explains that their theory of the destruction of the ordning might explain the reports she's been receiving of increased fire giant activity in a wide swath of the north, and it gives her a fresh argument to explain to her director, Dr. Podocarpus Bongley, in favor of an expedition to a site in the Dessarin Hills.

It seems that a small coal mine in that region (a few days' travel from Triboar) has recently run into what seems to be a tomb - Plank believes that it's a fire giant tomb, from their descriptions of its architecture, and thinks it may be offer a clue to what the fire giants are after.

Gilbert smiles politely and starts sidling out the door as Colin blurts out an offer to help with Plan's expedition. She happily accepts, and agrees to meet the party in three days' time to depart. She tells Gilbert that they could help her try to convince Dr. Bongley that it's worth paying the adventurers, and Gilbert smiles once more and sidles out the door.

Gilbert and Colin meet up with Taz in the market square, where they see a capable-looking woman in chain mail emerge from the Lord Protector's tower and greet a pair of mounted constables, discussing a recent dispute between two outlying ranchers.

The party decides to invesigate the missing druid, Moonbeam - they find Darz Helgar in the north caravan campground and offer to aid his search. Helgar accepts their offer and allows them to search Moonbeam's still-standing tent, which contains a small diary with a crude map. The map indicates the grove of Gwaeron's Slumber, with a central location marked, a looping path nearby, and a large area away from the grove marked with the notation "GWAREON?!?"

The next morning, our heroes set forth and investigate the locations marked on the map. At the central location, they find an enormous tree, under which many people have obviously sat or slept. Oddly, there is an enormous pair of heavy bare footprints in the dirt under the tree, and a matching pair about thirty feet away to the north. To the west, the party can trace a set of human-sized footprints heading out and then back towards the tree.

Following this trail, the party finds themselves in the outer edges of the grove, and Taz beholds a young man stumbling out from behind a tree, who Darz confirms matches the description of Moonbeam. Colin and Gilbert catch up, and Moonbeam describes his experience, getting lost while searching for mushrooms in the northern woods. Actually, he says, he found a really cool one, and he invites the party behind the tree to check it out.

Colin excitedly dashes around the tree as "Moonbeam" pulls a glaive from the soil behind the tree and, grinning an inhuman grin, slashes at him with it. Colin is taken aback, and "Moonbeam" makes a leap into the tree above him, vanishing as he does so. The party sees a series of tree beams bend as he makes his way, invisible, leaping from branch to branch to the north.

Colin takes a moment to heal himself and the party discusses what to do next. Colin puts his helmet of telepathy on and waggles it around, seeking a clue - to the north, the helmet picks up a strange signal, and Colin sprints off in that direction.

Gilbert, following closely behind, notices a strange lensing effect as Colin crosses some kind of barrier, and the tone of the forest shifts, getting darker, closer and quieter. A decrepit shack with a half-destroyed roof stands among the trees in the distance.

Colin approaches the shack and hails it loudly - as the echoes are fading, the party hears a twig snap between him and the shack - Darz and Taz, from their stealthy vantage points, ready their bows. An oni appears on the ground in front of Colin, grinning the same terrible grin, and exhales a cone of freezing air, which immediately knocks him unconscious. Simultaneously, Darz and Taz make their shots, which go wide.

Gilbert retailiates with a bolt of lightning, which arcs from the dodging Oni to the shack behind him, and Darz and Taz sprint forward to close with the great beast. Darz weaves cautiously near the creature, distracting its attention so that Taz can score a deep wound with his rapier. The oni roars and counterattacks with his glaive, but Taz's fast feet minimize the effect. Gilbert hits him with a scorching ray, and the beast looks concerned - attempting to run, he is brought down with a flying tackle from Taz and knocked unconsious.

Colin comes to and the party restrains and tries to communicate with the oni, who gazes levelly at them and says nothing. Their attempts at magical persuasion fail, and Colin turns to check out the interior of the shack - as he does so, Taz's rapier "slips" and the story of the oni comes to an end.

Searching the shack, our heroes find a basement full of humanoid bones, including clothing that Darz identifies as having belonged to Moonbeam, and the oni's hoard of treasure - 226 gold worth of gems and goins, and a strange pair of magnifying spectacles.

Darz congratulates our heroes on solving the mystery of Moonbeam, and offers them a future favor in the Triboar area, if they need a hand. Gilbert inquires as to the inheritance of Moonbeam's tent, which Darz grants him.
