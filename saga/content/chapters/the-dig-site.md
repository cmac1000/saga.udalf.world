On the third day of travel, the party encounters a fearsome troll guarding a narrow bridge over a canyon. However, he happily accepts the carved wooden halfling statue that the party found in the slain hill giant's bag, and they traipse happily onward.

That night, a raiding party of goblins attempts to catch them unawares. However, Taz raises the alarm and our heroes fend off the raiders with no losses.

Heading down the Dessarin river, the party encounters a halfling with a pair of donkeys, being towed upriver. He introduces himself as Grundlesticks, and Professor Plank recognizes his robe as that of her University's hated rival, Yartar University. He's friendly but unhelpful when asked for information about the dig site.

With a trick involving an open bottle of ink, the party satisfy themselves that nothing invisible is being carried on the raft: Grundlesticks is unamused.

A few hours later, the party finds a mine entrance and heads in, encountering a group of similarly-robed figures. They introduce themselves as:

* Poppy Grisaille, a professor of history (a wiry woman about the same age as Dyllis Plank)
* Ulrich Thinne, a professor of divinity (a saturnine man with a dark beard)
* Stomes and Abeth (two well-armed graduate students)

Dyllis Plank seems to recognize Grisaille, and treats her frostily.

The Yartar academics claim to be at a loss with how to proceed - the room has a barricaded passage to the north and a downward passage to the east. Taz scouts the eastern passage, discovering the bodies of two slain dwarven miners, and a pair of helmed horrors standing silent vigil before an ornate door carved with giant runes.

The Yartarians demur when the party suggests a joint attack, claiming to be noncombatants, and Colin begins industriously breaking open the northern barricade. He eventually succeeds and dashes happily into the darkness. Following, Taz and Gilbert feel a sense of being watched as they cross by a pair of desiccated, dwarf-sized bodies. Taz fires an arrow at one of them, and they spring to action, clutching ancient mining picks.

Combat ensues, in which one of the wights manages to get a hand on Gilbert, badly shaking him. Our heroes, however, prevail (the Yartarians having fled as the wights emerged) and the wights fall, crumbling quickly to dry dust.

At the end of the northern passage, the party finds a recently-constructed winch system connected to a wooden platform, hanging over a deep cave, which extends vertically above them as well before disappearing into darkness.

Taz talks to Plank, trying to get more information on Grisaille. Plank explains that she and Grisaille were both graduate students together in Waterdeep, 30 years ago. She's a bit vague on the precise nature of their falling out, but considers her deeply dishonorable, and warns that she is not to be trusted.
