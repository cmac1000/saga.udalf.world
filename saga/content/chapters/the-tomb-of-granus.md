The party uses the winch system to lower themselves into a deep pit. On the second level, they find a narrow tunnel, tool-dug and very old, leading into a ancient room with giant runes and dwarf-sized sarcophagi. The runes are elliptical, but the thrust is that invaders of the tomb below will be punished, and that "the slaves will guard their master forever". Four of the sarcophagi are empty - pushing a closed one open, Colin beholds a bony dwarvish figure, similar to the two fought on the upper level.

Returning to the winch platform and descending deeper, the party finds another skeleton half-buried in the dusty earth. Colin performs a brief Eldathian service and feels a presence depart. Gilbert notices a discontinuity on the southern wall and points it out the Taz, who heads towards it to smash a hammer into it - but as he approaches, his danger sense tingles, and he withdraws, laying down caltrops, to fire an arrow into it.

An umber hulk, who'd been lying in wait in the tunnel, bursts forth and smashes Taz into unconsciousness. Gilbert blinks into the ethereal plane and sneaks into the tunnel behind the monstrosity, as Dyllis Plank engages it in fisticuffs, and Colin restores Taz to consciousness. The hulk wheels and crashes through the tunnel in pursuit of Gilbert, and Colin catches it with a bead of force, trapping it in a translucent sphere.

Gilbert catches the creatures eye with his hypnotic gaze, and Dyllis and Taz time a sneak attack for the dissolution of the sphere, bringing the hulk down.

Looking around, the party finds themselves in the lower tomb, with a giant-sized sarcophagus, a copper-plated dragon skull, and carved, ruby-encrusted walls. The sarcophagus lid has dislodged in the fighting, and peering within the party sees:

* an 18-foot tall entombed giant skeleton
* an elaborately carved maul, as tall as the giant
* a giant-sized ring
* a glowing orb on a great chain around the giant's neck

The carvings on the walls speak of the glorious deeds of Granus, in epic battles against the perfidious dragons. A colossal humanoid form is shown repeatedly on the carving, zooming through the air and smashing dragonic shapes. Taz's written giant is pretty good, but Granus' title eludes him - the rune seems to combine elements of the giant runes for "flying" and "leader".

The party confers with Professor Plank, who is delightedly copying down the inscriptions. She suggests that the depicted colossus may be the legendary Vonindod, a supposed superweapon from the thousand-year war, but she's never heard the name Granus.

On his ethereal jaunt, Gilbert got a sense that the sarcophagus was particularly warded, but that the rest of the room was unmagical. Accordingly, the party crowbars many large rubies from the wall, but decides that the copper-plated skull is too heavy to transport.

Colin dons the helm of telepathy, and tunes it toward the giant in the tomb - he encounters a vast mind that seems surprised to encounter him. He asks this mind if there's anything Eldath can do for him. The mind laughs derisively, and declines the offer.

The party departs, leaving the glittering treasures in the sarcophagus untouched. As they pass through the mine en route to the surface, they again encounter the Yartarian academics, who seem happy to see them. Taz passes on information and warnings about what's below - Poppy Grisaille seems interested in the treasure, and Ulrich Thinne strokes his beard at Colin's description of the vast mind he contacted. The party departs the mind, reconvenes with Farem and the Yoliennes, and make camp for the night.

Around midnight, a muffled boom sounds deep beneath the earth, and smoke billows out of the mine entrance. No survivors emerge...
