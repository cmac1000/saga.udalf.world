The party meets Daratha Shendrel, Triboar's Lord Protector, and asks if there are any disputes to be mediated (there are not). Colin inquires about land for a temple, and Shendrel suggests that such a project would cost around 8000 GP.

# Foehammer's Forge

The party heads to Foehammer's Forge to speak with Ghelryn Foehammer about his golem troubles. He seems content to berate the great clay automoton, and Igor (the golem) is inscrutable. Taz tries out a nice rapier, on sale for 500 GP, but it's beyond his current means.

# Trip to University

At the University, the party appeals to Director Podocarpus Bongley for official support for their venture. The loathsome director eventually coughs up 50 gold, which our will heroes use to hire a two halfling caravan guards (Calmita and Thamelle Yolienne) and a human guide (Farem, a former shepherd in the region), and buy a mule (Brayfields).

Colin asks if there's a good spot for a shrine to Eldath nearby, and the director suggests a small pond north of campus. Colin finds it and performs a basic consecration. Then, he sends messages to Snigbat and Thomas Korbinian at the Waterdeep Eldathian temple, letting them know the latest news.

# Departure to Dessarin Hills

The party departs to the southeast with Dyllis Plank and their hired hands. On the second day of travel, they encounter a hill giant, which Taz obliterates with guerilla tactics.
